# MovieLand

MovieLand is a web application where you can search movies from the The Open Movie Database (https://www.omdbapi.com/). The app was made by following 
the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&t=1493s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery.

## Tech stack
- ReactJS

## Features
- Search movies by name

## What I've added
- Instead of starting the search by clicking the search button, you can now use the enter button to search.
