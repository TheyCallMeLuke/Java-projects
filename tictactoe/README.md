# Getting Started with Create React App

This was my very first React project ever. It's not much but it's honest work. The purpose of this project was just to become acquainted with the framework React.

## What it does

- You can sort the moves in ascending / descending order

## What I've learned

- Learning what React is and what are its benefits
- React components
- Working with web browser developer tools
- Lifting shared state up
- Keeping data immutable whenever possible
